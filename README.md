# PID Control System Simulations

This repository contains various Python-based PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control simulations applied to real-world engineering problems.

## Included Projects

### 1. Vehicle Cruise Control (`cruise_control.py`)
Maintains a target vehicle speed by adjusting acceleration based on velocity error.

### 2. Thermostat System (`thermostat_control.py`)
Simulates room temperature regulation, accounting for external heat loss and heater output.

### 3. Drone Altitude Hold (`drone_altitude_control.py`)
A more complex simulation that manages drone thrust to maintain a specific height against gravity.
